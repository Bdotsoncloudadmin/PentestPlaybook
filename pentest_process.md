# Pentest Process

### Scoping (Comes directly from client)

### Recon (passive and active, OSINT & Scanning)

#### passive (Googling/OSINT/HUMINT)

<----------------------> 

Line in the Proverbial Sand|Federal Offense Territory

#### active (Make sure machine is online/finding other machines, find open ports, look for vulnerable services/webpage)

- ([Ping Sweep](./ping_sweep.md) (-sn/for loop one-liner/arp -a){this is how we verify where other machies are on the network}, NMap (fast,service,all scans){This is how we find open ports on targets}, Vuln Assessment (Openvas, Nessus){These can be used to find Low Hanging Fruit on an engagement}, phishing/social engineering)
- (Brute forcing accounts/emails)

### Exploitation 

- Find vulnerability via scanned service
- find exploit Proof of Concept (PoC) code/payload via Google or seachsploit 
- [catch a reverse shell](https://github.com/Gadoof/Gadoof/blob/main/reverse_shell_playbook.md#basic-reverse-shell)
- [upgrade your shell](https://github.com/Gadoof/Gadoof/blob/main/reverse_shell_playbook.md#enable-fully-interactive-shell)
	- Remember that this process is dangerous if you're using an unstable exploit!

### Post-Exploitation

#### - [priv esc](./priv_esc_playbook) = get to root

- linpeas/winpeas

#### - pivoting = 

- [ping_sweep](./ping_sweep.md)
- check arp cache
- [proxychains from Kali](./pivoting_playbook.md)

#### - persistence = setup a way for the box to always send you a reverse shell

- This process becomes CRITICAL if you're using an unstable exploit, you do this before you upgrade!

#### - data exfil = loot 

- hard coded passwords
- ssh/rsa keys
- hashed passwords in /etc/shadow) 
- ctf flags 
- look for password reuse attack opportunities
