# Pentest Process

### Scoping (Comes directly from client)

### Recon (passive and active, OSINT & Scanning)

##### passive (Googling/OSINT/HUMINT)

<----------------------> 

Line in the Proverbial Sand|Federal Offense Territory

##### active (Make sure machine is online/finding other machines, find open ports, look for vulnerable services/webpage)

- (Ping Sweep (-sn/for loop one-liner/arp -a), NMap (fast,service,full scans), Vuln Assessment (Openvas, Nessus), phishing/social engineering)

- (Brute forcing accounts/emails)

### Exploitation (Find vuln, find exploit poc/code/payload, catch a reverse shell, upgrading your shell)

### Post-Exploitation (pivoting, persistence, priv esc, data exfil)

##### - [priv esc](./priv_esc_playbook) = get to root; linpeas/winpeas

##### - pivoting = ping_sweep, check arp cache, proxychains from Kali

##### - persistence = setup a way for the box to always send you a reverse shell

##### - data exfil = loot (hard coded passwords, ssh/rsa keys, hashed passwords in /etc/shadow) ctf flag *look for password reuse attack opportunities
